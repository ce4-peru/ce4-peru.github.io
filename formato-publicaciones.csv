Travel time to health facilities as a marker of geographical accessibility across heterogeneous land coverage in Peru,En revisión,30-03-2020,30-03-2020,"This study sought to estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility in rural and urban areas across heterogeneous land coverage types in Peru as a means to help resources prioritization, disease surveillance, as well as prevention and control strategies. Multiple sources of geospatial data were fitted with a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach to produce high-resolution (30 m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate health facility across the country.
